The goal of this game is simple; it is a maze game where you navigate through a literal maze until you reach the goal (represented by the hexagonal block). The movements of the character is also very simple (using arrows to move, mouse to look around, no jumping mechanics). The shotgun is simply there for a better reference of where the character is looking.
